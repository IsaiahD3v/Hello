# Hello
Well, i'm trying to do well at my degree at IFMS. 
the said degree is computer engenereing, and so ill try to upload some develoments and my learnings here in this repository...
most of those are just as simple as you would imagine of someone who haven't touched computers in a more fundamental level before.
  Besides those academic endevours, i may also add some projects of mine. feel free do feedback criticize them as it fits your eyes,
as most of those will be incomplete and simple.

well, with that said, Heres a better introduction of me!

I'm isaias, i joined engeneering for some reasons
I like information, the ways things works and why they do work the way they do.
as a enthusiast on music, i have seen programs that can show a music sheet and then, capture the audio of the instument and based on that and other metrics provide the user with an extimate of how good or how bad their performance was.
The systems that make this possible really capture my interest, the way software is developed and the reasons that keep people moving towards the improviment of them.
back in 2021, i was in a self teaching english journey, that led me to this group of americans, british, and some europeans, with the objective of making a game.
we were all yong and neither of us knew exactly what were doing. games are not easy to be made when you want to integrate art into them. there games and there experiences, and we wanted the experience.

slowly we figured out ways to advance our way into the project, where i saw myself as one of the lynch pins of its unfoldings.
I was coming together with concepts that integrated music, hystory and some cuture. the thrill of seaching for information and the seeing the process and the project slowly taking form really exited me. i always had a thirst for information, thats how i learnt english. just pure, thirst. some would say even obessional.

years later i spoke to an product owner, working in the spain hq of a global company, his engeneering background and experience dealing with people made me grow further interested in the idea of development, and leadership.

those experiences helped me choose my compEngeneering degree.
some wished me luck, and maybe i might need more blood and sweat then anticipated.

so sumarizing

I like tech, Music, (some)Games and information(or knowledge).
and, tech
